## Review Panel Provenance (#540)

[`reviewer_full` letters only — other modes describe their own panel composition and omit this block. Exactly one of:
- "Reviewer 2 ran on [cross-model family] via the cross-model reviewer track; the remaining reviewers ran on [primary family]. Cross-family splits are visible in the panel matrix (no aggregate is computed)." /
- "All five reviewer personas ran on a single model family ([family]). Persona diversity is not model diversity — blind spots may be correlated across reviewers (Ren et al. 2026, arXiv:2607.13104 §5.2)." /
- "Cross-model dispatch for Reviewer 2 failed ([reason]); the slot fell back to [primary family]. Single-family caveat applies."]

## Decision *

### [Accept / Minor Revision / Major Revision / Reject]

[If Reject, indicate subtype: Out of Scope / Fundamental Flaw / Insufficient Contribution / Premature / Resubmit Encouraged]

---

## Top Blocking Issues * (0–3, ranked)

<!-- #574 E7: the 0-3 issues that currently BLOCK acceptance, most severe first,
     each with its evidence anchor and the roadmap item that resolves it, so the
     author does not have to synthesize the blockers across five long reports.
     ZERO rows is valid for a genuine Accept — never manufacture blockers to
     fill the section. -->

| Rank | Blocking issue | Source reviewer(s) | Evidence anchor | Resolving roadmap item |
|------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | [Issue] | [EIC/R1/R2/R3/DA] | [typed — `<type>: <locator>`, transported from the finding (#574 A2)] | [Rn — the Roadmap's own ID syntax, e.g. R1] |

## Reviewer Summary

| Reviewer | Role | Recommendation | Confidence |

## Consensus Analysis *

### Points of Agreement (Consensus)

**[CONSENSUS-4]** (All reviewers agree):
1. [Consensus content — cite relevant passages from each reviewer's report]
2. [...]

**[CONSENSUS-3]** (3/4 reviewers agree, the 4th **silent**):
1. [Consensus content — indicate which 3 agree and name the silent 4th. If the 4th *disputes* the sub-claim rather than being silent, it is a SPLIT (see Points of Disagreement), not a CONSENSUS-3.]
2. [...]

### Points of Disagreement

**Disagreement 1: [Issue name]**
- **R[X] view**: [Specific viewpoint, citing report]
- **R[Y] view**: [Specific viewpoint, citing report]
- **Disagreement type**: [Perspective difference / Severity disagreement / Existence disagreement / Direction disagreement]
- **Editor's Resolution**: [Arbitration result]
- **Resolution Rationale**: [Arbitration rationale — based on evidence/expertise/unresolved-dissent principle (#574 B1)]

**Disagreement 2: [Issue name]**
- [Same format as above]

---

## Decision Rationale *

[200-300 words explaining the basis for this decision]

Requirements:
- Cite specific reviewer opinions
- Explain how disagreements were resolved
- Explain why this decision was chosen rather than a more or less strict one
- If Reject, explain why revision also cannot salvage it

## Required Revisions * (Must Fix)

[Only needed for Minor Revision and Major Revision]

| # | Revision Item | Sub-Claim(s) | Severity | Evidence Anchor | Confidence | Source Reviewer | Section | Estimated Effort |
|---|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| R1 | [Description] | [SC-n] | [transported: critical/major (+ fallback tag if any)] | [`<type>: <locator>`] | [n — basis] | [EIC/R1/R2/R3] | [Section name] | [X days] |
| R2 | [Description] | [SC-n] | [transported] | [transported] | [transported] | [Source] | [Section name] | [X days] |
| R3 | [Description] | [SC-n] | [transported] | [transported] | [transported] | [Source] | [Section name] | [X days] |
...

The `Sub-Claim(s)` column carries the Step 1b `sub_claim_id`(s) the item traces to (e.g. `SC-1`); a DA-CRITICAL or non-decomposed item uses `—`.

### Required Item Details

> **Ordinal contract (#576 §5.1):** `R<n>` numbering here FOLLOWS the Revision Roadmap's `must_fix` order — the letter and the Roadmap are the same synthesizer emission, so the nth Required block corresponds to the Roadmap's nth `must_fix` item, and the blocks appear as exactly the contiguous sequence `R1..Rn` (no gaps, duplicates, or extras). This is the derivation basis for the Stage 3' criterion inheritance join (`letter_item_ref`) and is checker-recomputed; a violated sequence degrades the whole letter criterion layer (`[CRITERIA-LAYER-ABSENT: letter/roadmap ordinal mismatch]`). The pin covers the R side ONLY — the Suggested table legitimately mixes P2/P3 items, so `S<n>` carries no ordinal contract. The **Acceptance criteria** field stays a SINGLE-LINE bullet (`- **Acceptance criteria**: <text>`) — the machine grammar `scripts/check_re_review_synthesis.py` parses.

**R1: [Title]**
- **Problem**: [Specific description]
- **Source**: [Which reviewer raised it, citing report passage]
- **Requirement**: [Specifically how to fix it]
- **Acceptance criteria**: [How to confirm the issue is resolved after fixing]

**R2: [Title]**
- [Same format as above]

## Suggested Revisions (Should Fix)

| # | Revision Item | Sub-Claim(s) | Severity | Evidence Anchor | Confidence | Source Reviewer | Priority | Section | Expected Improvement |
|---|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| S1 | [Description] | [SC-n] | [transported] | [transported] | [transported] | [Source] | P2 | [Section name] | [What it improves] |
| S2 | [Description] | [SC-n] | [transported] | [transported] | [transported] | [Source] | P2/P3 | [Section name] | [What it improves] |

## Format Guidelines

### Revision Roadmap Design Principles

1. **Actionability**: Every item is a concrete task, not an abstract suggestion
2. **Traceability**: Every item can be traced back to specific reviewer comments
3. **Prioritization**: Priority 1 > 2 > 3; authors can process in order
4. **Time estimation**: Helps authors plan their revision timeline
5. **Compatibility**: Format can be directly used as `academic-paper` revision mode input

### Severity-to-Priority Mapping

| Severity | Priority | Revision Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Critical | P1 | Required Revision |
| Major | P1/P2 | Required / Strongly Suggested |
| Minor | P2/P3 | Suggested |
| Editorial (not a finding severity — formatting/language items, Schema 7 `type`) | P3 | Optional |

Finding severity is the Schema 6 enum (`critical` / `major` / `minor`) transported from the reviewer cards (#574 A3) — the roadmap never re-derives it.
