"""Dispatch one E4 seeded-defect panel with the evidence contract enforced.

`reviewer-e4/2026-07-27` requires that every checker-rejected model response
and its checker output survive a retry. Hand dispatch lost that on both
launched panels of the 2026-07-27 fleet, because a retry wrote over the
response it was retrying. Preservation cannot be a step an operator performs
at the moment they are trying to get a run to proceed (#608).

So this harness inverts the order: a response is written to a path that
CANNOT be overwritten, and only then is a checker allowed to judge it. A
retry is a new path. Preservation therefore precedes the decision to retry
rather than depending on it, and the four closed status fields are derived
from what the artifacts show rather than typed by hand.

Checkers run as subprocesses with relative paths from the work directory, so
the captured bytes are the checker's own output with no absolute prefix to
strip: every stored diagnostic is `verbatim`, never `normalized`.

Measurement-side only. It sequences existing calls and existing checkers; it
asks the panel nothing new, changes no verdict, and cannot move a review-side
metric.

Run:
