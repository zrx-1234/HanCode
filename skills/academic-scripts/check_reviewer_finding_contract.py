"""Reviewer finding-contract lint (#574 behavior batch: A1/A2/A3/B1).

Pins the behavior batch's prompt surfaces so the drift classes it retired
cannot silently return:

- A1 — finding quotas removed + Coverage Receipt: the four scoring agents and
  the peer-review template carry NO `(3-5 items)` / `List 3-5` quotas, carry
  the canonical `## Finding Contract` block verbatim, and carry the Coverage
  Receipt surface (zero findings requires a receipt, not silence).
- A2 — typed evidence anchors: the template owns the six-type anchor
  vocabulary + the Critical/Major MUST-anchor rule; the DA tables carry the
  `Evidence Anchor` column; the skill's Specificity standard is anchor-typed.
- A3 — severity single source + transport: Schema 6 carries the canonical
  enum sentence + the optional `evidence_anchor` / `confidence` /
  `competence_basis` fields; the synthesizer transports (never re-derives)
  severity/confidence with visible fallback tags; the decision standards use
  no parallel severity scale.
- B1 — register/severity separation + no base-rate anchoring: the decision
  standards carry the Decision Symmetry section; the EIC and synthesizer
  carry no acceptance-rate/base-rate anchors.

COMMIT-TIME text pin only (witnesses are hardcoded literals per the repo's
defrift-lock discipline); it does not measure runtime reviewer behavior — that
is the E4 seeded-defect held-out set's job. Companion mutation test:
test_check_reviewer_finding_contract.py.

Threat model: ACCIDENTAL drift by well-intentioned edits — deletions,
rewordings, relocations, renames, and ordinary quota re-spellings. An
adversarial repo editor is explicitly out of scope: anyone who can craft a
pathological decoy in these files can equally edit this lint, so the terminal
defense for that class is human review of lint-file diffs, not ever-deeper
witness scoping.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_reviewer_finding_contract.py
    python scripts/check_reviewer_finding_contract.py --root PATH   (for fixtures)

Exit codes: 0 pass / 1 fail / 2 invocation error (missing file).
