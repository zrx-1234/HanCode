    "`fatal` binds to the Phase 1 fatal trigger, a dissented dimension cannot "
    "be fatal, and a non-mandatory dimension has no `block_class:`. "
    "6. Finding grammar: apply the role-specific grammar above. For a scoring "
    "seat, every weakness is its own `### W<n>` subsection with exactly one "
    "parseable Severity, one typed Evidence Anchor, and one Confidence; every "
    "strength has a typed Evidence Anchor and no Severity. If either finding "
    "polarity is empty, include its required Coverage Receipt. For the DA, "
    "emit exactly one `#### CRITICAL` table and one `#### MAJOR` table, both "
    "present even when empty, with no standalone Severity. Each table header "

    "blank lines to the end of Review Body. Do not emit HTML comments anywhere "
    "in a DA report. "
    "7. Anchors: no findings share an anchor. Every anchor uses a valid typed "
    "`<type>: <locator>` value with balanced wrappers. Every `text:` anchor "
    "contains at least one balanced quoted verbatim excerpt, and each quoted "
    "excerpt is at most 25 words. Every `absence:` anchor uses the exact "
    "required separators and non-empty fields. "

    "output, confirm at least one quoted excerpt exists, count each quoted "
    "excerpt in a `text:` anchor, and shorten any excerpt over 25 words; never "
